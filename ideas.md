# Todo website ideas

- Task structure
  - Title
  - Category (optional)
  - Type
  - Link or short reminder (where to find the task for example) (optional)
  - Due (when the task is wanted to be completed)
  - Deadline (just in case you fail to do it due, final deadline)

- Default types
  - Homework
    > Easy
    > Hard
  - Long term project
    > Easy
    > Hard

- Tasks would be listed according to their type and due date
  - Prioritization can be modified in settings types
  - By default, homework due tomorrow will be prioritized highest, then long term projects. Hard over easy.
  - By default, easy homework due is equal to deadline, hard homework due is day before the deadline (if possible), easy long term project due date is 3 days before deadline and hard is 2 weeks.
    > Under construction, also hard homework and long term projects could be added to todo after their expected due date (according to deadline)

- Tasks can be split to sub tasks or progress
  - Then the due date could be split up between the tasks, especially if it is a long term project over a long period of time

- Can set when the task is due and by when you want to complete it
  - The gap between that also depends on task complexity, but can be selected manually

- Task type (complexity) selection and usage
  - A complexity or just type can be assigned to a task, which will affect prioritization and other factors
  - Some default types are given to the user but new ones can be created manually or with AI in your settings

- AI features
  > AI features
    - AI chat to add, modify tasks with all parameters required
      - When adding / modifying tasks, AI will propose how the task would look now in a nicely styled container (possibly like it would look in the task list) and only when you confirm, changes will be actually applied
    - AI to change your settings (for example personalized types list)
      - That also, before changes are applied, they are presented to the user.

  > AI chat style
    - In every window there is icon at the bottom right to open pop up chat there, but there is a dedicated page to just AI
    - Good looking design
